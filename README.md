## How to Use

You'll be asked to input a string and you'll be presented 4 lines:

## Line 1: 
      Subtracts a random letter based on the random integer generated.
## Line 2:
      Switches the number on the right of your random integer letter and moved it to the left of it.
      
## Line 3:
      Takes the string you inputted and reverses it.
      
## Line 4:

      Takes the string inputted and then prints out the orgiinal string up to your random integer generated, then reverses the string. 
      
      
This project contained a lot of String methods including : [substrings, StringBuilder, string.length(), append, reverse, and scanner objects for .nextInt]
